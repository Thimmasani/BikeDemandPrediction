# BikeDemandPrediction

### General Information
* **Background:** This project explores bike rental demand patterns using historical data from a bike-sharing service. Understanding these patterns helps in optimizing bike availability and improving customer satisfaction.
* **Business Problem:** The project addresses the need for accurate demand forecasting in bike-sharing services. By predicting bike rental demand, the service can better manage inventory, adjust pricing, and plan promotions.
* **Dataset:** The dataset used includes variables such as season, month, weekday, weather conditions, year, working day, and holiday status, alongside bike rental counts.

### Technologies Used
* Pandas - version 1.5.3
* NumPy - version 1.24.1
* Scikit-learn - version 1.2.2
* Matplotlib - version 3.7.1
* Seaborn - version 0.12.2

### Conclusions
* **Seasonal Effects:** Bike rentals peak during the summer and fall, while they are lower in winter and spring. This indicates that warmer and milder weather conditions drive higher bike rental demand.
* **Weather Impact:** Clear weather significantly increases bike rentals, whereas conditions like light snow and misty/cloudy weather decrease demand. Weather is a key factor influencing bike usage.
* **Temporal Trends:** Bike rental demand has increased over the years, with higher demand observed in 2019 compared to 2018. This suggests a growing trend in bike-sharing popularity.
* **Significant Variables:** Temperature, year, and weather conditions are the most significant predictors of bike rental demand, with temperature having the strongest positive impact and light snow the most significant negative impact.
